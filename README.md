This project documentation provides an overview of the GitHub workflow strategy used to manage issues, boards/projects, pull requests (PRs), and branching. This setup streamlines project development, ensures clear organization, and maintains high-quality code, supporting smooth collaboration and release cycles.

Issues – Issues act as to-do items for all project tasks, from fixing bugs to adding new features. We create an Issue for every task, assign it to team members, and use labels (like "bug," "feature," "documentation") to categorize it. This keeps everyone on the same page, helps prioritize work, and prevents tasks from being missed.

Project Boards – We use GitHub’s project board as a visual tracker for our work. Tasks move through columns like Backlog, In Progress, Review, and Done. This setup gives the team a clear, at-a-glance view of the project’s progress, making it easy to see what’s being worked on and what’s completed.

Pull Requests (PRs) – Whenever we add new code, we open a PR for review. Each PR is linked to an Issue, giving context to the changes. Other team members review, test, and give feedback on the PR to ensure quality. Once approved, it’s merged into the main codebase, keeping our code reliable and collaborative.

Branching Strategy – We use a branching system to keep our code organized. The main branch holds final, stable code ready for deployment. The develop branch gathers new work for testing. Feature branches are used for specific tasks (like a new feature or fix), keeping work separate and reducing conflicts. This allows the team to work in parallel without interfering with each other’s progress.
