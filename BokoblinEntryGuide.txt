Open Ground Camps: These camps are in clearings with little natural cover. The best approach here is often from a higher vantage point. Look for nearby hills or rocks that give you a good view and the element of surprise.

Forest Camps: Camps in wooded areas offer cover for a stealthy approach. Enter through dense foliage and pick off Bokoblins one by one with stealth attacks or sneak strikes.

Lakeside Camps: These camps may have enemies near water, which can be used to your advantage. Using an entry point on higher ground or sneaking in from the water can give you an edge, especially if you have Cryonis to create ice platforms.

Fortified Camps with Watchtowers: Camps with towers or structures are more guarded. Look for blind spots where you can sneak in undetected or use ranged weapons to take out the lookouts first. Approaching from the sides or back often gives the best vantage point.
